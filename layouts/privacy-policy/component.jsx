            <h2>Personal information we collect</h2>
            <p>
              We collect different kinds of information from you, depending on
              how you interact with us.
            </p>

            <p>
              Online collection: We collect personal information from you when
              you register to receive email communications, make donations,
              apply for jobs, send email inquiries, register for events, or
              participate in other parts of our Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Depending on the Services you interact with, the information
              collected may vary and may include, for example:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Identifiers and contact details you choose to provide, such as
                your name and email address;
              </li>
              <li>
                Emails, messages, posts, and other communications and
                information you choose to share via email or over social media;

              <li>Payment information;</li>
              <li>
                Location information: WRI rarely collects location information
                about you. In some cases, we may ask for information about your
                location for limited purposes. For example, users of the
                TerraMatch application may enable collection of geolocation
                information on their mobile devices in order to map the
                boundaries of a proposed tree planting project. The Forest
                Watcher application geotags user field reports and users may
                also enable GPS tracking to record their traveled route. This
                location data collected on TerraMatch and Forest Watcher is not
                used for any other purpose or shared with or sold to third
                parties;

              <li>
                Automatically collected information: We and our third-party
                service providers may collect information about your interaction
                with our Services using cookies and similar automatic
                data-collection technology. We use this information to improve
                and maintain our Services, collect aggregate site usage reports
                that do not identify you individually, and to optimize site
                users&apos; experience on the Services. The information we
                collect includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Identifiers like IP address and device and browser

              </li>
              <li>
                Anonymous or aggregated information: We may use aggregate or
                deidentified data that doesn&apos;t identify you for any lawful
                business purpose.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Offline collection: We also collect personal information from you
              when you provide us with it at conferences or similar events. Such
              personal information will typically consist of your organizational
              or personal contact details, donation information, or other
              information you choose to give us.

              WRI takes reasonable steps to protect the personal information
              that you provide. We use a variety of security technologies and
              procedures to help protect your personal information from
              unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the
              personal information you provide on secured computer servers that
              are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we
              transmit sensitive personal information over the internet, we
              protect it through the use of appropriate technological and
              administrative means.

            <p>
              We do our best to maintain the accuracy of any personal

              the accuracy of any personal information you supply by notifying
              WRI of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail
              address. In some parts of the WRI Services, you may do this online
              by following the instructions on membership profile pages. You may
              also do this by using the contact information provided below.

            <p>
              Where necessary, we may need to transfer your personal information
              to another country. These transfers can take place within the WRI
              group but also may be made to selected third parties (as explained
              in the <b>Disclosure of information</b> section of this Privacy
